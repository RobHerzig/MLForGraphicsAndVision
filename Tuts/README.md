The tutorial is meant to help you during the *entire* course. 

We know that it is dense, and we do not expect you to understand everything in the first weeks. Play around with the jupyter-notebook file. 

Maybe find some good hyper-parameters for the Rosebrock function example (and send them to us in case you identify some) or destroy the optimizer routine by choosing some bad step-sizes. Or even change "A" to "-A" in the quadratic form example.  Just to see what works and what does not work.

- cd path/to/this/file
- type "jupyter notebook" in terminal
- launch your browser at http://localhost:8888

Consider this information as a cheat-sheet for basic usage of TensorFlow.
